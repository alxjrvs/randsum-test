## What is this?

It's a dice roller! Specifically, it's a random number generator that generates numbers from 1-N, rather than traditional random number generators, which work from 0-(N-1).

It accepts basic number and number strings, as well as dice notation for more complicated dice operations.

Check out the docs below for more info!

## Why did you make this?

Sometime around 2012, I decided I wanted to learn to program. I had installed ruby on the best laptop six-hundred dollars could buy, set to make a dice roller as an easy first project.

I spent an easy 30 minutes trying to figure out how to make `rand(n)` return `1-n` instead of `0-(n-1)`.

When I found the answer, I laughed and laughed. I've been chasing that high ever since.
